# Half of Australian airports were busier during pandemic

<b>Business Insider Australia | September 2021</b>

Most Australian airports were busier during the last financial year than pre-pandemic, an analysis of air traffic data has revealed, with FIFO workers in the west driving much of the demand.

That's despite lockdowns grounding flights, decimating profits across the aviation industry and turning the country's busiest airports, like Sydney and Melbourne, into virtual mausoleums.

While the overall number of planes in the air has been decimiated, at many of the country's smaller airports, runways have been busier in FY20-21, the first since the arrival of COVID, than in 2019, the year that preceeded it.

The uptick in flights across regional Western Australia has mirrored the buoyancy in the price of resources and the state‚Äôs renewed appetite for mining exploration.

### 
At Boolgeeda, the Pilbara airport which services Rio Tinto‚Äôs Brockman 4 iron ore mine, Virgin is landing up to a dozen times a day at the moment. 

Callion Airport, which sat disused in 2019, has welcomed hundreds of flights this year as Ora Banda ramps up its Davyhurst Gold Mine. 

And traffic at Ravensthorpe, which services First Quantum‚Äôs nickel mine west of Esperance, is this year already around 70 per cent above 2019 levels. 
 
An analysis of data from flightaware.com shows they are among hundreds of Australian airports - most of them in regional WA - that have seen an increase in traffic during the pandemic.

The number of extra flights these airports are receiving are a fraction of those the industry has lost.[graph 3]

But in WA, they reflect one of the big positives in the economy at large, and are one of the few glimmers of light in an otherwise gloomy time for aviation.

‚ÄúTalking to major airlines, WA‚Äôs about the only line item in black for them at the moment,‚Äù said Rob Carruthers, the Director of Policy and Advocacy at the Chamber of Minerals and Energy Western Australia.

‚ÄúQantas is running a bunch more Airbus A320s, whereas previously they were running smaller aircrafts. 

‚ÄúThe charter flights that are often direct to private mine sites have increased pretty considerably since pre-pandemic times.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve worked pretty closely with [the aviation industry] during the pandemic. We‚Äôve done everything that we can to keep on going, and they responded amazingly.‚Äù

Keeping the industry COVID-free and in full swing helped the state deliver a $5.6 billion surplus in this month‚Äôs budget. 

It‚Äôs also been a small win for Perth Airport, the hub for most of these flights. Arrivals and departures have fallen less drastically there than at its major east coast counterparts.[graph 4]

Through parts of the pandemic, Perth has even had the busiest runways in the country. And while Sydney and Melbourne slumped to previously unthinkable lows, it notched up its busiest June for regional passenger numbers on record, the airport said. 

Almost 4.5 million regional passengers passed through the airport in the last financial year, it said, an 11 per cent jump on the comparable period prior to the pandemic. 

‚ÄúThe resources sector relies heavily on its FIFO workforce, and those workers rely on Perth Airport to get them safely on their way to where they are needed and to help bring them home again,‚Äù its Chief Operating Officer, Scott Woodward, said.

Despite "some big financial losses‚Äù - overall passenger numbers are down almost two-thirds - the airport has "done the right thing by Western Australia by keeping our runways and terminals operating", Woodward said.

‚ÄúPerth Airport has made significant sacrifices to remain operational during Covid to keep the State‚Äôs FIFO workforce flying.‚Äù

Over east, domestic holiday makers helped Ballina's Byron Gateway airport record the second biggest increase in arrival and departure last financial year (when compared to 2019), behind only Toowoomba‚Äôs Wellcamp. 

Airports at Hamilton Island and Shute Harbour in Queensland's Whitsundays also saw strong growth in that period.

But those gains are well and truly dwarfed by losses elsewhere, Tourism & Transport Forum Chief Executive Margy Osmond says.

‚ÄúWhile there certainly have been some key tourism destinations that have experienced greater numbers of passengers through their airports, this was mainly due to travel within their own states due to the uncertainty around domestic borders. 

‚ÄúIt was also prior to the latest round of state lockdowns, which still remain in place.‚Äù

She says passenger numbers to the Sunshine Coast have been down as much as 95% in recent months, with similar losses in Cairns and Far North Queensland. 

‚ÄúWhat the sector needs from both federal and state governments is a continued clear pathway to both interstate and international reopening well before the end of the year, so Australians can plan their summer holiday travel with certainty and confidence and start making bookings today."

Could the correction in iron prices also see the skies go quiet over Western Australia? 
Rob Carruthers doesn‚Äôt think so. 

‚ÄúI expect the production landscape to remain strong through the mid-term. All the major producers have strong guidance around maintaining and incrementally increasing production. 

‚ÄúClearly the demand for iron ore is going to be predominantly met by Western Australia producers in the short and medium term.‚Äù

## Sourcing the data

Data for this project was sourced from flightaware.com. Data for each discrete airport is stored on the site as .rvt files. 

These can be accessed by running a query that references an airport four-letter International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) code. For Melbourne, for example, that means it requires YMML, rather than MEL, the three-letter IATA code that passengers to the airport will be familiar with.

Automation was buily around the following function, makign the retrieval process quick, effiecent and repeatable.

```
def getTrafficByIcao(airport_icao):
    
    response = get('https://flightaware.com/ajax/ignoreuser/airport_stats.rvt', params = {'airport': airport_icao})
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    df = pd.DataFrame(json.loads(str(soup))['chart_data'])
    df.insert(0, 'airport_icao', airport_icao)
    
    return df
 ```

Being such a large country, there are hundreds of airports spread across Australia, many of the remote and infrequently used. A comprehensive list of each airport and its relevant details was found in a HTML table at fallingrain.com, and downloaded with the following code.

```
def getAusIcaoCodes():
    
    response = get('http://www.fallingrain.com/world/AS/airports.html', params = None)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    table = soup.find('table')
        
    df = pd.DataFrame(columns = [x.text for x in table.find_all('th')])
    for tr in table.find_all('tr'):
        if len(tr.find_all('th')) == 0:  ## ignore header
            df.loc[df.shape[0]] = [x.text for x in tr.find_all('td')]
                               
    return df
    
getAusIcaoCodes()
```
